Prismatic Jane Eyre is a research project aiming to grasp and think about Jane Eyre’s existence as a world work: that is to say, the fact that it co-exists in many languages, contexts and times, in very many different translations – at least 600 of them. Details can be found in the project’s website –  https://prismaticjaneeyre.org/ – and in its open access book: Prismatic Jane Eyre: Close-Reading a World Novel Across Languages: https://www.openbookpublishers.com/books/10.11647/obp.0319
